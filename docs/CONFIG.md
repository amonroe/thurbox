# Configuration Reference

Every knob thurbox reads, where it lives, and how it behaves. One file
per audience/lifecycle: hand-edited registries are TOML, the
machine-written keybindings are JSON, and concurrently-written runtime
state lives in SQLite (see ADR-8/ADR-19 in `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the
rationale).

`ui/plugins.toml` and `ui/plugins.lock` are the one pair that share a
format and split on lifecycle instead: the spec is composition you
maintain, the lock is a record nothing hand-edits. It is the same split
`.bundled.json` and `ui.json` already make, and the reason is the same —
a merge conflict in the record must not dirty the half a person wrote.

Dev builds (version `0.0.0-dev`) use `thurbox-dev` in place of
`thurbox` in every path below, plus a `thurbox-dev` tmux socket, so a
development checkout never touches your real setup.

## Files at a glance

| File | Format | Edited by | Read | Purpose |
|------|--------|-----------|------|---------|
| `~/.config/thurbox/agents.toml` | TOML | you | **live** (mtime poll) | coding-agent CLI definitions |
| `~/.config/thurbox/hosts.toml` | TOML | you | startup | remote SSH hosts + local WSL distros |
| `~/.config/thurbox/settings.toml` | TOML | you + `Ctrl+,` panel | **live** (feature flags) / startup (rest) | tuning knobs + feature flags |
| `~/.config/thurbox/themes.toml` | TOML | you | startup | custom theme palettes |
| `~/.config/thurbox/hooks.toml` | TOML | you | on each session operation | **session lifecycle hooks** — your commands, run before/after a session is created, deleted, restarted or restored |
| `~/.config/thurbox/ui/` | Lua | you | **live** (watched, 120 ms debounce; `F10` forces) | **the interface itself** — one file per pane, plus `layout.lua`, `lib/`, `AGENTS.md`/`README.md` for whoever edits it, and a directory per plugin installed from a repository (its own working copy, `.git` included) |
| `~/.config/thurbox/ui/plugins.toml` | TOML | you (or `thurbox-cli plugin`) | on each `plugin` command | **what the interface is composed of**: a source, a destination file and an optional pin, per installed pane |
| `~/.config/thurbox/ui/plugins.lock` | TOML | `thurbox-cli plugin` | on each `plugin` command | what each entry resolved to, and the digest of every file delivered. Machine-written — commit it beside the spec and the same interface reproduces elsewhere |
| `~/.config/thurbox/ui.json` | JSON | `F1` / Interface tab (or you) | startup | your decisions *about* the interface: rebound chords, plugins turned off, files trusted, plugin settings. Written back only by a registry that **read** it (`registry::Origin`), so a process holding no decisions cannot empty it |
| `~/.config/thurbox/extensions/<name>.toml` | TOML | `thurbox-cli extension install` | startup + tick | extension manifests (self-healed resources) |
| `~/.config/thurbox/keybindings.json` | JSON | — | **never** | v1's chord overrides. **Ignored**: rebindings live in `ui.json`. Left alone rather than deleted, so going back to 1.x still finds it |
| `~/.local/share/thurbox/thurbox.db` | SQLite | thurbox | live | sessions, automations, tasks, theme, editor command |
| `~/.local/share/thurbox/thurbox.log` | text | thurbox | — | logs (incl. config warnings) |

`agents.toml` and `settings.toml` reload **live**: the TUI polls their
mtime (~1/s) and applies edits with a confirmation toast — no restart.
The `ui/` directory reloads live too, but on a **filesystem watcher**
(120 ms debounce) rather than a poll, and `F10` forces one. For
`settings.toml` the flags that apply live are `shell_pane`, `perf_hud`
and `soft_delete`; the restart-only values stay
published through a write-once global (so they can't drift mid-frame),
and the reload toast says when a restart is needed. `hosts.toml` (SSH
backends register at startup) and `themes.toml` need a restart.

`settings.toml` can also be edited from the TUI: **`Ctrl+,`** (alt `F6`)
opens a **Settings panel** listing every knob. It writes the file back
**preserving its comments**, and feature flags that gate UI panels apply
**live** on save; the rest (`mouse`, `notifications`, `automations`,
`version_check`, `auto_update`, the four editable `[notifications]` knobs,
and the scalars) take effect on the next launch — the panel marks those rows
with `⟳` and toasts a restart note. The panel exposes only the four
editable notification knobs (`also_on_waiting`, `suppress_for_active`,
`sound`, `min_interval_secs`); `[notifications] backend` is **not** in
the panel — set it only by hand-editing `settings.toml`. Hand-editing
the file (or the panel in another instance) is picked up the same way,
via the live mtime poll.

All paths respect `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` / `$XDG_DATA_HOME`.

### Which file do I edit?

A task-to-file map so you don't have to scan every section to find
the right knob:

| I want to… | Edit | Section |
|------------|------|---------|
| Add a coding agent, pin a model, change resume/fork flags | `agents.toml` | [agents.toml](#agentstoml) |
| Run sessions on a remote machine over SSH, or in a local WSL distro | `hosts.toml` | [hosts.toml](#hoststoml) |
| Turn a whole TUI feature on/off (tasks, mouse, notifications…) | `settings.toml` `[features]` | [`[features]`](#features--whole-feature-switches) |
| Tune scrollback, panel breakpoints, audit retention | `settings.toml` | [settings.toml](#settingstoml) |
| Change when/how OS notifications fire | `settings.toml` `[notifications]` | [`[notifications]`](#notifications--os-notification-settings) |
| Add or recolour a TUI theme | `themes.toml` | [themes.toml](#themestoml) |
| Run my own command when a session is created/deleted/restarted/restored, or refuse one | `hooks.toml` | [hooks.toml](#hookstoml) |
| Rebind a key | `keybindings.json` (or the F1 editor) | [keybindings.json](#keybindingsjson) |
| Set the `Ctrl+O` editor, pick a theme | (runtime — SQLite) | [SQLite-backed settings](#sqlite-backed-settings) |

None of these files need to exist on a fresh install — every one is
seeded (commented-out where applicable) on first run, and absent files
fall back to built-in defaults.

Config problems are **not silent**: parse errors, unknown fields,
invalid chords, and chord conflicts surface as a status-bar toast on
startup (and in the log file). Unknown TOML keys are tolerated —
stale keys from older versions or typos are *reported by name* but
your file still loads — while syntax/type errors fall back to
built-ins (agents), zero hosts, or defaults (settings).

`agents.toml` degrades **per entry**: a single malformed `[[agents]]`
block (e.g. `args` given a string instead of an array) is skipped with
a toast naming it, and your remaining agents still load — only a
document-level syntax error (or a file with no usable agents) falls
back to the built-ins.

Check everything from the command line:

```bash
thurbox-cli config validate   # strict parse of every file; exit 1 on problems
thurbox-cli config show       # effective config + where each value came from
```

`validate` fails on unknown keys (they are typos or leftovers either
way), making it usable as a dotfiles CI gate.

## agents.toml

Declares the launchable coding agents. Seeded with the built-ins
(`claude`, `codex`, `antigravity`, `opencode`, `aider`, `copilot`, `vibe`, `pi`,
`omp`) on
first run; edit or add `[[agents]]` entries to support any CLI — no
recompile. A malformed `[[agents]]` entry is skipped (with a toast
naming it) and the rest still load; only a document-level syntax error
falls back to the built-ins. Either way the error is shown.

The file is **seeded once** and never rewritten — so it stays yours to
edit, but a thurbox **update that adds a new built-in agent does not
merge it into an existing `agents.toml`**. To pick up a newly-bundled
agent, add its `[[agents]]` block by hand (copy it from this file's
built-in list) or delete `agents.toml` to re-seed the full set. The
matching status hook is wired automatically once the agent's config dir
exists — the built-in hooks extension self-heals on every startup/tick,
independent of `agents.toml`.

```toml
config_version = 1
default = "claude"          # agent preselected in the picker / headless spawns

[[agents]]
name = "claude"             # display + lookup name (unique)
command = "claude"          # executable
args = []                   # always passed; bake a model here if you want one
resume_args = ["--resume", "{id}"]            # emitted when resuming
fork_args = ["--resume", "{id}", "--fork-session"]
new_session_args = ["--session-id", "{id}"]   # emitted on a fresh spawn
resume_latest = false       # true = id-less "resume last session in cwd"
# hook_schema = "claude"    # optional: name the hook FAMILY this CLI speaks so
                            #   the built-in hooks extension wires its status
                            #   hooks under this custom agent's name too
```

`{id}` is substituted with the thurbox-generated session UUID. `{home}`
is substituted with the resolved home dir at spawn time (the remote home
for an SSH/WSL host) — for an agent that wants a session *file path*
rather than a bare id. The built-in `omp` (Oh My Pi) uses it: it generates
its own internal id and won't take thurbox's, but its `--session <path>`
creates a fresh session at a missing path, so thurbox maps its UUID to a
deterministic `--session {home}/.omp/agent/sessions/thurbox-{id}.jsonl`
(creation) / `--resume` the same (restart). `{home}` is expanded by
thurbox, not the shell — args are POSIX-quoted, so a literal `~` would
never expand. `omp` ships no `fork_args`, so `Ctrl+F` starts a fresh
session (OMP has no way to pin a fork's target file to a thurbox UUID).
Groups
are emitted only when their driving value exists; precedence is
fork > resume > new-session. See the seeded file's comments and
the `thurbox-agents` skill for the `resume_latest` semantics.

`hook_schema` is optional. Custom agents are agent-neutral, so the built-in
**hooks** extension normally wires status hooks only for the built-ins it knows
by name. Set `hook_schema = "claude"` on a **rebranded** agent (one whose
`command` runs `claude` under a different `name`) and it inherits claude's hook
wiring — the `--settings` patch locally, and the same rewrite on a remote/WSL
host. It names the *family* to imitate, not a boolean; see
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#hook_schema-custom-rebrands-only) for which family is
actually useful today and why.

The seeded file also ships two commented, copy-pasteable templates
below the built-ins — **Add your own agent** (every field annotated)
and **Pin a model** (a `claude-opus` variant baking `--model opus`
into `args`). Both stay commented, so a fresh install still resolves
to exactly the ten built-ins (nine coding agents plus `shell`).

For **each built-in's** exact config and runtime behavior (resume/fork
semantics, ID model, and which status-hook mechanism it uses), and the
checklist for **adding a new built-in**, see
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## hosts.toml

Declares off-local hosts — **remote SSH machines** and **local WSL
distros**. Each `[[hosts]]` entry registers a session backend named
`ssh:<name>` (default kind) or `wsl:<name>`. Seeded fully commented-out
(fresh installs are local-only for SSH). Malformed file → zero
configured hosts, error shown.

| Field | Required | Default | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| `name` | yes | — | backend id `ssh:<name>` / `wsl:<name>`; what `--host` expects |
| `kind` | no | `ssh` | transport: `ssh` (remote machine) or `wsl` (local distro) |
| `destination` | for ssh | — | ssh target (`user@host` or `~/.ssh/config` alias) |
| `distro` | no | `name` | WSL distro name (`kind = "wsl"` only) |
| `ssh_opts` | no | `[]` | extra ssh flags, one token per element (ssh only) |
| `socket` | no | `thurbox` | host `tmux -L` socket |
| `session` | no | `thurbox` | host tmux session name |
| `worktrees_dir` | no | host `$HOME/.local/share/thurbox/worktrees` | absolute worktrees dir on the host/distro |
| `multiplexer` | no | `tmux` | host multiplexer binary; set to `psmux` for a Windows SSH host |
| `share_sessions` | no | `true` | the host's own database is the record of its sessions: mirrored here, operated through the host's `thurbox-cli` (provisioned under `~/.local/share/thurbox/bin/` — `thurbox-dev/bin/` for a dev build — there when missing); `false` = drive the host from here as before |

**SSH** auth comes entirely from your `~/.ssh/config`; thurbox never
handles credentials. **WSL** distros are reached with
`wsl.exe -d <distro>` and need no config entry at all — on Windows they
are **auto-discovered** (`wsl.exe -l -q`) and appear in the host picker
and `--host` automatically; add a `kind = "wsl"` entry only to override
a default (e.g. `worktrees_dir`). For both kinds, tmux, git, the agent,
and worktrees all run **on the host / inside the distro** at native
paths (a WSL distro's worktrees live in its own Linux filesystem, not on
`/mnt/c`); the distro needs `tmux` >= 3.2 and `git`. Host changes
require a restart (the registry is read once and each host's `$HOME` is
cached for the process lifetime).

## hooks.toml

Declares **session lifecycle hooks**: your own shell commands, run by
thurbox before and after it creates, deletes, restarts or restores a
session. Seeded fully commented-out (a fresh install runs nothing); read
**each time an event fires**, so an edit is in force at the next
operation with no restart. Malformed file → no hooks run, warning in the
log, and `config validate` fails.

> Not the `hooks/` **directory** beside it. That is the home of the
> built-in `hooks` *extension*, which installs status-hook files **into**
> the agent CLIs so they can tell thurbox what they are doing
> (see [Session status](#session-status)). `hooks.toml` is the other
> direction: thurbox telling *your* scripts what *it* is doing.

```toml
[[hooks]]
event = "session.pre_create"
command = 'case "$THURBOX_BRANCH" in main|master) echo "refusing: protected branch" >&2; exit 1;; esac'

[[hooks]]
event = "session.post_create"
command = '[ -n "$THURBOX_CWD" ] && cp -n .env.local "$THURBOX_CWD/.env"; true'
timeout_secs = 120
```

| Field | Required | Default | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| `event` | yes | — | one of the eight events below |
| `command` | yes | — | run through `sh -c` (`cmd /C` on Windows) |
| `timeout_secs` | no | `30` | the hook is killed after this long |

**Events** — a `pre_*` fires before the operation has any side effect, a
`post_*` after it has fully succeeded (never after a failure):

| Operation | Events | Fired by |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| create (incl. fork) | `session.pre_create` / `session.post_create` | the creation flow, `Ctrl+F`, `thurbox-cli session create`, a `spawn` automation, an extension's sessions |
| delete (soft or force) | `session.pre_delete` / `session.post_delete` | `Ctrl+D`, `thurbox-cli session delete [--force]`, extension uninstall |
| restart | `session.pre_restart` / `session.post_restart` | `Ctrl+R`, `thurbox-cli session restart` |
| restore (incl. undo) | `session.pre_restore` / `session.post_restore` | `Ctrl+Z`/`Ctrl+U`, `thurbox-cli session restore` |

Hooks fire **once per operation whichever interface asked**, because
every interface ends in the same pipeline (`session_ops`). Hooks for one
event run one at a time, in file order.

**A `pre_*` hook can refuse.** Exit non-zero (or exceed the timeout) and
the operation is aborted before it has done anything — no worktree, no
process, no row changed — with the hook's command, exit status and the
tail of its stderr as the reported reason (the in-flight error in the
TUI, the error and exit status of `thurbox-cli`). Later hooks for that
event do not run. **A `post_*` hook is informational**: every one runs,
a failure is logged to `thurbox.log` and carried in the CLI's JSON
(`hook_failures`), and never fails the operation. Each `post_*` is also
delivered to interface plugins as an event of the same name (`events = {
"session.post_create" }` + `on_event`; `docs/PLUGINS.md` → Events) — the
Lua side of the same vocabulary, informational for the same reason.

**What a hook receives.** Environment variables — **unset** (never
empty) when the fact is not known at that moment:

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `THURBOX_HOOK_EVENT` | the event name, e.g. `session.post_create` |
| `THURBOX_SESSION` | the thurbox session id (at `pre_create`: the id it will have if creation succeeds) |
| `THURBOX_SESSION_ID` | the agent's own conversation id |
| `THURBOX_SESSION_NAME` | the session name |
| `THURBOX_AGENT` | the agent name |
| `THURBOX_REPO` | the primary repository path |
| `THURBOX_CWD` | the directory the agent runs in (the worktree, or the symlink workspace of a multi-repo session); unset at `pre_create` |
| `THURBOX_BRANCH` / `THURBOX_BASE_BRANCH` | the worktree branch and what it was created from (base: create events only) |
| `THURBOX_HOST` | the remote host name; unset for a local session |
| `THURBOX_PARENT_SESSION` | the parent session id (a fork, or `--parent`) |
| `THURBOX_TASK` | the originating task id, for a task-spawned session |
| `THURBOX_CONFIG_DIR` / `THURBOX_DATA_DIR` | so a `thurbox-cli` run inside the hook hits the database of the thurbox that fired it |

The same facts — plus `worktrees` (`repo_path`, `worktree_path`,
`branch`), `additional_dirs`, `force` (delete) and `force_deleted`
(restore) — arrive as **one JSON object on stdin** (`jq -r .cwd`).

**Where and how it runs.** In the primary repository when that is a
directory on this machine, otherwise in thurbox's own working directory
— the repository is the one path that exists at every event (at
`pre_create` the worktree is not made; at `post_delete` it is gone).
With **no terminal**: stdin is the JSON, stdout/stderr are captured and
only their tail (500 chars) is reported, so a hook can neither draw on
nor read from the TUI's screen. A hook for a **remote** (SSH/WSL)
session still runs **locally**; `THURBOX_HOST` names the host and the
paths are the host's — `ssh "$THURBOX_HOST" …` from the hook is your
call.

`thurbox-cli config validate` strict-parses the file; `config show`
lists the hooks in force.

## settings.toml

> The `F6` / `Ctrl+,` panel edits this file: core settings are listed above
> whatever plugins declared, `⟳` marks the ones that wait for the next
> launch, and `Ctrl+S` saves — written back through `toml_edit`, so the
> comments below survive.
>
> Four flags gate surfaces the interface **no longer draws**: `code_review`,
> `file_viewer`, `info_panel` and `tasks` (which still gates its CLI). They
> are accepted and preserved untouched so an existing file does not fail
> `thurbox-cli config validate`, and simply not listed in the panel, since a
> row that gates nothing reads as broken. `automations` is honoured, but it
> arms the headless heartbeat rather than an in-TUI scheduler.

Scalar tuning knobs plus the `[features]` switches, seeded fully
commented-out (defaults apply when absent). Only knobs a user plausibly
wants are exposed; internals stay hardcoded. The seed closes with a
**Common recipes** block — copy-pasteable groupings (bigger scrollback,
a minimal/focused TUI, notification tuning, enabling the update badge),
all commented so defaults still apply out of the box.

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `scrollback_lines` | `1000` | terminal scrollback kept per session |
| `two_panel_min_cols` | `80` | width below which only the terminal renders |
| `three_panel_min_cols` | `120` | width unlocking the optional third column |
| `audit_retention_days` | `90` | audit + session-event history kept (pruned on startup) |

A complete `settings.toml` showing every knob at its default — copy
this, uncomment what you want to change, and restart:

```toml
config_version = 1

# Scalar tuning knobs (top level)
scrollback_lines      = 1000   # terminal scrollback kept per session
two_panel_min_cols    = 80     # width below which only the terminal renders
three_panel_min_cols  = 120    # accepted and ignored (v1's third column)
audit_retention_days  = 90     # audit + session-event history kept (pruned on startup)

[features]
shell_pane    = true
perf_hud      = true
soft_delete   = true
automations   = true
mouse         = true
notifications = true
version_check = true           # on by default (1.0): makes a network call
auto_update   = true           # on by default (1.0): downloads + replaces binaries

[notifications]
also_on_waiting     = false    # also fire when a session finishes (Working → Done)
suppress_for_active = true     # skip the session you're currently viewing
sound               = true     # play the OS default notification sound
min_interval_secs   = 5        # per-session floor between notifications
```

### `[features]` — whole-feature switches

Switch off behaviour that reaches outside the interface. All default to
`true` — as of 1.0 that includes `version_check` and `auto_update`, which
both reach the network (they were opt-in before 1.0). `shell_pane`,
`perf_hud` and `soft_delete` apply **live** on save; `automations`,
`mouse`, `notifications`, `version_check` and `auto_update` take effect on
the next launch. Data is never touched, so re-enabling a flag is lossless.

**A pane is not switched off here.** Panes are files, so turning one off
is `space` on its row in the Interface tab (`Ctrl+,` then `]`), recorded
in `ui.json`. That does strictly more than a flag could: it works for a
plugin *you* wrote, which no compiled-in flag could know about.

Five keys are **accepted and ignored**: `tasks`, `file_viewer`,
`info_panel`, `code_review` and `global_search`. They gated v1 panes the
binary no longer draws, and nothing reads them now — not even the plugins
that give `code_review` and `info_panel` back
([`thurbox-code-review`](https://github.com/Thurbeen/thurbox-code-review),
[`thurbox-info-panel`](https://github.com/Thurbeen/thurbox-info-panel)),
which are switched on and off from the Interface tab like any other pane.
They are still parsed rather than rejected, so an existing `settings.toml`
keeps loading instead of failing on an unknown key — but setting one has no
effect in either direction. Same for `three_panel_min_cols` above.

| Key | Default | Controls |
|-----|---------|----------|
| `shell_pane` | `true` | per-session shell toggle (`Ctrl+T`) |
| `perf_hud` | `true` | perf HUD overlay (`F12`): live perf counters + frame/tick timing (see `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`) |
| `automations` | `true` | TUI schedule firing + heartbeat arming (the CLI stays fully functional) |
| `mouse` | `true` | mouse capture: clicks, wheel, drag-select, hover, scrollbars |
| `notifications` | `true` | OS desktop notifications when a session needs attention |
| `soft_delete` | `true` | TUI `Ctrl+D` soft-deletes (Ctrl+Z undo); off = hard delete after a confirmation prompt |
| `version_check` | `true` | GitHub update check: TUI header "update available" badge + `thurbox-cli version --check` |
| `auto_update` | `true` | Silent self-update **within the current major**: download + verify + replace the binaries on startup + `thurbox-cli update`; also auto-refreshes stale extensions |

`automations = false` is a full stop on the TUI side: the pane
disappears (the session list takes the whole left column and `j`/`k`
wrap within it), and the TUI neither fires due schedules nor arms the
tmux heartbeat keeper on startup. Explicit `thurbox-cli automation`
commands still work — and `automation create` still arms the
heartbeat, so an already-armed keeper window (or an OS timer from
`packaging/`) keeps firing schedules externally. Disabling
`shell_pane` hides existing shell panes but never kills their
processes. `mouse = false` skips terminal mouse capture entirely, so
the terminal keeps its native mouse behavior (its own text selection,
URL handling, etc.) and no click/wheel/hover handling runs in the TUI.
`notifications = false` keeps the background dispatcher thread from
ever starting (zero overhead) and silently no-ops every transition;
the session status display itself is unaffected.

`soft_delete = false` turns the TUI's `Ctrl+D` into a destructive
**hard delete**: instead of marking the row deleted with a `Ctrl+Z`
undo window, it kills the session's tmux window, removes its worktrees
and symlink workspace, and disables any pending `Send` automations —
after a confirmation prompt (`Enter`/`y` to delete, `Esc`/`n` to
cancel), since the teardown is irreversible. The row is marked
**first**, before anything comes down: a crash partway through the
teardown would otherwise leave an active session whose worktrees are
already gone. It is marked force-deleted with it, so `Ctrl+U` lists it
and refuses — unless every worktree was one thurbox merely opened
rather than created, in which case nothing was lost and the restore
stands (which re-spawns it fresh). This flag governs the TUI only:
`thurbox-cli session delete` always soft-deletes unless you pass
`--force`, regardless of the setting.

`version_check` (on by default for 1.0) enables the update check — it
makes a network call. On launch the TUI reads a cached result
(`~/.local/share/thurbox/version-check.json`) and, if it is older than
24 h, fires a single best-effort background fetch of GitHub's latest
release (`api.github.com/repos/Thurbeen/thurbox/releases/latest`, via
`curl`/`wget` — no new dependency); a newer release shows a `⬆ vX.Y.Z
available` badge next to the version in the header. The fetch never runs
on the render path and never blocks startup; failures are silent. Dev
builds (`0.0.0-dev`) never show the badge. The same flag enables
`thurbox-cli version --check`, which fetches fresh on demand and reports
current vs. latest (`thurbox-cli version` with no flag always prints the
current version, regardless of the flag).

`auto_update` (on by default for 1.0) goes a step further than
`version_check`: instead of just showing a badge, the TUI **silently
updates itself** on startup. On every
launch (it does **not** reuse the `version_check` badge's 24 h cache — sharing
that gate let the badge keep the cache "fresh" and starve the updater) it
fetches the latest release tag; if a newer release exists it downloads that
release's tarball + checksums from GitHub Releases (`curl`/`wget`, no new
dependency), verifies the SHA256 (`sha256sum`/`shasum`), extracts it
(`tar`), and atomically replaces the installed `thurbox`/`thurbox-cli`
binaries in place — mirroring `scripts/install.sh`. The download is verified
**before** any installed file is touched, so a failed/corrupt download leaves
the current binaries untouched; the whole step runs before the TUI takes the
terminal and is best-effort (any failure is logged and startup continues on
the current version). The replaced binary takes effect on the **next launch**
(the running process keeps its open file), so the TUI shows an "Updated to
vX.Y.Z — restart to apply" status line. `thurbox-cli update` performs the
same update on demand (with `--force` to bypass the up-to-date, dev-build and
major-version guards); dev builds (`0.0.0-dev`) never auto-update. The default install
location (`~/.local/bin`) is user-writable; a system-wide install in a
root-owned directory will fail the replace (logged, non-fatal). `version_check`
and `auto_update` are independent — enable either or both.

**Auto-update never crosses a major version.** A 1.x install is told that 2.x
exists (the badge, and `thurbox-cli version --check`, both report it) and is
never moved onto it; it keeps updating along 1.x. This is not conservatism about
version numbers — 2.x replaced v1's compiled-in interface with the Lua plugin
kernel, so a silent crossing would hand someone a different program under the
same binary name. `thurbox-cli update --force` is the deliberate way across, and
the first v2 launch of a profile with v1 history still asks before anything
changes. The guard is `agent::version_check::crosses_major`, and it applies to
every future major too.

> Only a binary that *carries* the guard is protected by it. Releases up to

`auto_update = true` also keeps **installed extensions** in step with the
binary. Extension versions are pinned to the binary's release tag, so an
extension only goes stale (`installed_with` ≠ the running binary) right after an
upgrade. The self-heal pass — which already runs on TUI startup and on the
headless `automation tick` — then refreshes each stale extension in place
(re-fetching it from its recorded source) instead of only nudging you to run
`thurbox-cli extension update`. The staleness check is local and network-free,
so a launch where nothing is stale does no extra work; a refresh runs at most
once per extension per binary version. With `auto_update` off, the nudge is
shown and you update extensions by hand.

### `[notifications]` — OS notification settings

Surfaces an OS notification when a session **transitions into a state
that needs your attention**. The trigger is the hooks-driven
[session status](#session-status) (reported by the agent's hooks, *not*
the terminal bell / output): the notification fires when a session crosses
into `Blocked` (the agent needs input or approval) and, with
`also_on_waiting = true`, also when it finishes a turn (`Working → Done`).
The edge is detected once per tick in `kernel::notify`, reading the same
`SessionState` the session-list status icon draws, so the banner can
never drift from the list (see `docs/FEATURES.md` → *Why the transition is
observed in one place*) — then deduped per session (`min_interval_secs`)
and skipped for the session you're currently viewing (`suppress_for_active`).
The notification body is the agent's last OSC 9 / OSC 777 message when
present (truncated to 200 chars), otherwise `Waiting for input` — the OSC
message is kept only for the body text, no longer for the trigger.
**Only fires while the TUI is open** — the dispatcher thread runs only
inside the TUI, so a headless `automation tick` never notifies.

**Delivery backend** (`backend`, default `auto`) is detected at startup:

| Backend | When | Click-to-focus |
|---------|------|----------------|
| `dbus` | normal Linux desktop with a running notification daemon (`org.freedesktop.Notifications`) | **yes** — clicking the banner writes a focus request the running TUI reads next tick and switches to that session |
| `windows` (toast) | **native Windows**, or **WSL** / any Linux with no dbus daemon — delivers a Windows toast via `powershell.exe` (WSL needs interop, on by default) | no (a Windows toast can't call back into the thurbox process) |
| `macos` | macOS native banner. Uses **`terminal-notifier`** when it's in `PATH` (own bundle + icon, looks like a real app notification — `brew install terminal-notifier`), otherwise the built-in **`osascript`** `display notification` (attributed to Apple's Script Editor). The `UNUserNotificationCenter` click API needs a signed `.app` bundle, which thurbox is not, so the `osascript` path is informational | **with `terminal-notifier`** — clicking the banner runs `thurbox-cli session focus <id>`, which writes the same metadata row the dbus path does and the TUI picks it up next tick. Without `terminal-notifier` (osascript fallback): no |

`auto` prefers `dbus` whenever a daemon answers, and only falls back to
the Windows toast when no dbus service is reachable. Force a specific
path or disable delivery with `backend = "dbus" | "windows" | "off"`
(`off` is a soft switch distinct from `[features] notifications`, which
stops the dispatcher thread entirely).

This auto-detection fixes a previously **silent failure** on WSL: the
dbus path errored on connect, but the only signal was a line in the
logfile, so the user saw nothing. Delivery errors are now recorded and
surfaced by the diagnostic:

```bash
thurbox-cli notify          # show the detected backend + last delivery error
thurbox-cli notify --test   # fire a sample notification to confirm it works
```

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `also_on_waiting` | `false` | also fire when a session finishes (`Working → Done`); the field name is historical |
| `suppress_for_active` | `true` | skip the notification for the session you're currently viewing |
| `sound` | `true` | play the OS default notification sound |
| `min_interval_secs` | `5` | per-session floor between two notifications (dedup) |
| `backend` | `auto` | delivery backend: `auto` \| `dbus` \| `windows` \| `off` |

Notifications fire on the hooks-driven status transitions (see
[Session status](#session-status)): always on `→ Blocked` (the agent needs
you), and with `also_on_waiting = true` also on `Working → Done`.

## Session status

Each session's state (Blocked / Working / Done / Idle) is driven by
**agent hooks** that call `thurbox-cli session signal --state
<working|blocked|done|idle>`. The state is persisted on the `sessions` row
(`hook_state`, `hook_state_at`, `seen_at` — schema v34) and survives the TUI
being closed; a hook fired headlessly is picked up via `PRAGMA data_version`.
Identity comes from the injected `THURBOX_SESSION` env var, so a hook passes
no id. A finished turn shows `Done` (blue) — for the session you're watching too
— and becomes `Idle` once you switch focus off it.

The hooks are wired up automatically by the built-in **hooks** extension
(auto-activated on first run). Opt out with `thurbox-cli extension deactivate
hooks`. The status colours are tunable theme keys (`status_working` /
`status_blocked` / `status_done` / `status_idle` / `status_unreachable` /
`status_running` / `status_unknown` — see `themes.toml`). `status_running` is
an agent seen holding a pane that has reported nothing, and `status_unknown`
the two silences behind it (`uncovered`, `unreported`); both are spelled apart
from `status_idle`, which is the agent's own report that it is at rest.
`status_error` is a separate role, for a failed *command* in the list, not a
session state.

The wiring is applied **only to agents thurbox launches** — it never edits your
own global agent config (e.g. your personal `~/.claude/settings.json`). thurbox's
managed hook config lives per agent, applied by injecting a flag into
`agents.toml` or by a reversible merge into / managed file in the agent's own
config dir:

| Agent | On-disk location | How it's applied |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| claude | `~/.config/thurbox/hooks/claude.json` | `--settings` flag (claude merges it with your own settings) |
| aider | — (no file) | `--notifications-command` flag |
| opencode | `~/.config/opencode/plugin/thurbox-status.js` | managed plugin file |
| codex | `~/.codex/hooks.json` | reversible JSON-merge of thurbox's entries |
| vibe | `~/.vibe/hooks.toml` | managed file (refused if you already have one) |
| antigravity | `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json` | reversible JSON-merge of thurbox's entries |

The home dir is `~/.config/thurbox/hooks` on a release build and
`~/.config/thurbox-dev/hooks` on a dev build. Because claude *merges* the
`--settings` file, your own hooks still fire inside a thurbox session — both run.
Hand-edits to a managed file are rewritten from the embedded payload on the next
TUI start / heartbeat tick; to customize, deactivate the extension and wire the
hook yourself, or edit the payload under `extensions/hooks/` and reinstall. Full
per-agent detail: `extensions/hooks/README.md`.

## themes.toml

User-defined themes, offered in the `Ctrl+Y` picker alongside the thirty-six
built-in presets and persisted by `name` like any preset. Each
`[[themes]]` entry starts from a built-in `base` and overrides only the
colours it names:

```toml
[[themes]]
name = "my-mocha"            # stable id; must not shadow a built-in
display_name = "My Mocha"    # picker label (default: name)
base = "catppuccin-mocha"    # starting palette (default: default)
accent = "#fab387"
app_bg = "reset"             # keep the terminal's native background
```

Colours accept anything ratatui parses: `#rrggbb`, ANSI names (`red`,
`lightcyan`), indexed (`14`), or `reset`. The seeded file lists every
overridable key — including the code-review diff colours `diff_added` /
`diff_removed` (added/removed line foreground) and `diff_added_bg` /
`diff_removed_bg` (the subtle full-row tint). Bad colours and built-in name
collisions degrade to startup warnings (the base colour / the built-in stays in
effect).

## keybindings.json

Maps `Action` names to one or more chord strings:

```json
{ "QuitApp": ["ctrl+a"], "OpenThemePicker": ["ctrl+y", "f4"] }
```

- Preferred editing path is the **F1 panel** (live capture, conflict
  stealing, immediate persistence). Hand-edits are read at startup.
- Chord syntax: `[ctrl+][alt+][shift+][cmd+]<key>` where `<key>` is a
  letter, `f1`–`f12`, or a named key (`enter`, `esc`, `tab`, arrows,
  `home`, `end`, `pageup`, `pagedown`, `backspace`, `delete`,
  `insert`). Case-insensitive. `cmd` (aliases `super`, `command`,
  `win`) is the macOS Command key — delivered only by
  kitty-keyboard-protocol terminals (iTerm2 3.5+, kitty, WezTerm,
  Ghostty; not Terminal.app), and only for chords the emulator
  doesn't claim itself.
- Unknown action names, invalid chords, and the same chord bound to two
  actions in overlapping contexts are reported at startup (the file
  still loads; bad entries fall back to defaults).
- **Terminal passthrough.** When a session **terminal is focused**, the
  readline / shell line-editing chords (`Ctrl+A` start-of-line, `Ctrl+E`
  end-of-line, `Ctrl+W` delete-word, `Ctrl+U` kill-line, `Ctrl+R`
  reverse-search, `Ctrl+D` EOF, plus `Ctrl+B/F/O/P/S`) are **forwarded to the
  agent CLI** instead of triggering their thurbox command, so your terminal
  muscle memory works inside a session. Those thurbox commands stay reachable
  from the **session list** (focus it with `Ctrl+H`) and via their `F`-key
  alternates (`F2` info panel, `F3` file viewer, `F5` tasks). Rebinding such an
  action to a key that isn't a bare `Ctrl+<letter>` makes it work in the
  terminal too. Navigation/quit chords (`Ctrl+H/J/K/L`, `Ctrl+Q`, `Ctrl+N`) are
  **never** forwarded — they're how you leave the terminal.
- Action names and defaults: see the table in CLAUDE.md / README, or
  `src/session/keybindings.rs`.

## extensions/

Each opt-in extension (see `extensions/<name>/`) is described by a single
`extension.toml` manifest. `thurbox-cli extension install` writes the
home-resolved copy to `~/.config/thurbox/extensions/<name>.toml` (thurbox
never seeds this dir). The install **home** (where payload files land and the
session runs) defaults to `~/.config/thurbox/extensions/<name>/` — a sibling dir
of that manifest — unless the manifest pins a `home` or you pass `--home`. The
manifest has two halves — an **install** spec and a **runtime** spec:

```toml
name = "flow"
description = "Focus-protecting triage agent"
config_version = 1              # manifest *format* version (for migrations)
version = "1.0.0"              # the extension's own version (bumped by its author)
min_thurbox_version = "0.113.0" # minimum thurbox; older binaries get a warning
# home = "~/flow"               # OPTIONAL; default is <config>/extensions/<name>.
                                # {home} is substituted everywhere it appears

# install spec ---------------------------------------------------------------
[[agents]]                      # registered in agents.toml (existing kept)
name = "flow"
command = "claude"
args = ["--model", "claude-haiku-4-5"]

[[files]]                       # fetched from the source, written under home
path = "FLOW.md"
[[files]]
path = "scripts/create-task.sh"
executable = true               # chmod +x
[[files]]
path = "repos.md"
if_absent = true                # seed once; never clobbered on reinstall
[[files]]
path = ".claude/settings.json"
source = "claude-settings.json" # source path differs from dest
substitute = true               # replace {home} in the content

[[symlinks]]                    # never clobbers a real file at `link`
link = "CLAUDE.md"
target = "FLOW.md"

# Reaching OUTSIDE the extension home (used by the built-in hooks extension):
[[external_files]]              # write a file into an agent's OWN config dir
path = "~/.config/opencode/plugin/x.js"
source = "x.js"
requires_dir = "~/.config/opencode"  # skip when that agent isn't installed

[[agent_patches]]               # append args to an EXISTING agent (reversible)
name = "claude"
append_args = ["--settings", "{home}/claude.json"]

[[config_merges]]               # reversibly deep-merge into an agent's own
path = "~/.gemini/config/hooks.json"  #   SHARED config file (never clobbered)
source = "antigravity-hooks.json"  # objects recurse, arrays union; uninstall prunes
requires_dir = "~/.gemini"      #   exactly our entries (by marker). no-op write
                                #   when unchanged; malformed target soft-skipped
# format = "toml"                # OPTIONAL; JSON by default. Set for a TOML
                                #   shared config (agent::toml_merge via toml_edit).
                                #   TOML owns its entries by a comment on each, so
                                #   the payload must stamp every one of them

# runtime spec (ensured on activate, self-healed if deleted) -----------------
[[sessions]]
name = "flow"
agent = "flow"
repo_path = "{home}"            # absolute, `~`-relative, or `{home}`; resolved
                                #   to an absolute path at install

# [[automations]] is an OPTIONAL runtime resource (flow itself ships none —
# it is purely event-driven). An extension that wants a scheduled tick declares:
[[automations]]
name = "example-tick"
trigger = "cron:*/10 * * * *"   # same grammar as `automation create --trigger`
session_ref = "flow"           # must match a [[sessions]] name above
prompt = "tick"
```

Manage extensions with the CLI:

```bash
thurbox-cli extension install flow         # fetch + lay files + agents + activate
thurbox-cli extension install ./extensions/flow   # from a local dir
thurbox-cli extension install <url> --home ~/x    # from a URL, custom home
thurbox-cli extension uninstall <name>     # reverse install (keep home dir)
thurbox-cli extension uninstall <name> --purge    # also delete the home dir
thurbox-cli extension list                 # installed + active/healthy + version/stale
thurbox-cli extension update <name>        # re-fetch from recorded source (refresh)
thurbox-cli extension update --all         # update every installed extension
thurbox-cli extension update <name> --force # also overwrite user-edited seed files
thurbox-cli extension activate <name>      # (re)create resources + mark active
thurbox-cli extension deactivate <name>    # tear down + stop self-heal
thurbox-cli extension deactivate <name> --force --purge  # also kill tmux + drop manifest
thurbox-cli extension status [<name>]      # per-resource presence + version/stale
```

A bare name installs from the official source
(`raw.githubusercontent.com/Thurbeen/thurbox/<ref>/extensions/<name>`,
fetched via curl/wget) — `<ref>` is the running binary's release tag
(`main` for dev builds), so a fetched extension matches your binary. A
path or `http(s)://` URL installs from there instead. Payload paths are
validated against traversal (no absolute paths or `..`), and a
`substitute` file you've edited isn't overwritten on reinstall (use
`--force`). Payload files are fetched as **text** (specs/scripts/JSON),
not binaries.

While an extension is **active**, thurbox **self-heals** its declared
resources: on TUI startup and on every `automation tick` it re-creates
any session/automation that has been deleted. So deleting them by hand is
a no-op (they come back); `extension deactivate` is the real off-switch.
Self-heal while the TUI is closed depends on the automation heartbeat
(`[features] automations = true`); with automations off, healing happens
at the next TUI startup only.

### Versioning + the update lifecycle

Extensions carry two version markers, and the installer stamps two more
into the discovery-dir copy so staleness can be detected:

| Field | Where set | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `version` | source manifest | the extension's own semver (author-bumped) |
| `min_thurbox_version` | source manifest | minimum thurbox; older binaries warn |
| `installed_with` | stamped on install | the thurbox version that installed it |
| `source` | stamped on install | the target it was installed from |

A **bare-name** install (`extension install flow`) fetches from the
official source **pinned to the running binary's release tag**, so the
extension you get always matches your thurbox. When you later **upgrade
thurbox**, the on-disk copy is now older than the binary — thurbox
flags it as `stale` (in `extension list`/`status`, and as a one-line
nudge from self-heal at startup). Run `extension update <name>` (or
`--all`) to re-fetch from the recorded `source`; because a bare name
re-resolves against the *new* binary's tag, this pulls the version that
matches your upgraded thurbox. Updates honour the same file rules as
install — user-edited `substitute` files and `if_absent` seeds are
preserved unless you pass `--force`.

`min_thurbox_version` is a **soft** gate: an extension authored for a
newer thurbox still installs on an older binary, but install/activate and
self-heal emit a compatibility warning so the mismatch is visible.
**Dev builds** (`0.0.0-dev`) skip both the staleness and compatibility
checks — their version doesn't order against release tags.

**Rollback.** There's no version snapshot store: to roll an extension
back, pin a specific thurbox tag — `extension install
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thurbeen/thurbox/v0.112.0/extensions/flow`
— or downgrade the binary and run `extension update`, which re-resolves
the bare name to that older tag.

## SQLite-backed settings

Live in the `metadata` table and apply immediately (no restart):

| Key | Set via | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `active_theme` | `Ctrl+Y` / `F4` picker | TUI palette (fifteen built-ins) |
| `editor_command` | `thurbox-cli editor set "<cmd>"` | what `Ctrl+O` runs |
| `editor_mode` | `thurbox-cli editor mode <auto\|terminal\|gui>` | how `Ctrl+O` runs the editor: `auto` (default) detects terminal vs GUI and gives terminal editors a real TTY (tmux popup / TUI suspend); `terminal` forces the TTY path; `gui` forces detached |
| `active_extensions` | `thurbox-cli extension activate/deactivate` | JSON array of active extensions to self-heal |
| `builtin_hooks_optout` | `thurbox-cli extension deactivate hooks` | `1` when the user opted out of the auto-activated hooks extension |
| `perf_snapshot` | the TUI, while perf timing is active (`THURBOX_PERF_LOG` or an open perf HUD) | JSON perf snapshot read by `thurbox-cli perf` (see `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`) |

These are in the DB rather than a file because they are written
concurrently by multiple thurbox processes (TUI, CLI, MCP) and picked
up live via `PRAGMA data_version` polling.

## Environment variables

User-set (read by thurbox):

| Variable | Used for |
|----------|----------|
| `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME` | config/data roots |
| `VISUAL`, then `EDITOR` | `Ctrl+O` editor when `editor_command` is unset |
| `SHELL` | the `Ctrl+T` companion shell pane (fallback `/bin/sh`). For a remote/WSL session the pane uses the **host's** `$SHELL` as an interactive login shell (the SSH-login environment), not the local one. |
| `RUST_LOG` | log filter for `thurbox.log` |
| `THURBOX_PERF_LOG` | opt-in performance logging: a one-shot `startup` phase breakdown at first paint, per-session `restore_adopt`/`adopt_split` lines, steady-state `perf_window` lines (~10 s cadence), and wall-clock frame/tick timing collection. Any value enables it. See `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`. |
| `THURBOX_SOCKET` | overrides the **local** multiplexer socket name, winning over the data-dir derivation below. For test/sandbox tooling: Unix scoping uses `TMUX_TMPDIR`, but psmux (Windows) resolves every `-L <name>` machine-wide, so this is the only way to fully scope an instance there. Remote hosts are unaffected (socket from `hosts.toml`). Empty = unset. |

Set **by** thurbox into every spawned agent process (not user-set;
`session_ops::inject_thurbox_env` / `App::build_spawn_inputs`). An
agent — or a `thurbox-cli` call running inside the session — reads
these to prove its own identity without scraping panes or names:

| Variable | Set into agent process |
|----------|------------------------|
| `THURBOX_SESSION` | the stable thurbox `SessionId` (the registry key); read back by `thurbox-cli message`/`inbox` for self-identity, and by `session signal` — see below |
| `THURBOX_SESSION_ID` | the agent's own conversation id (`agent_session_id`); consumed by the metrics statusline. Distinct from `THURBOX_SESSION` |
| `THURBOX_TASK` | the originating task id; task-spawned sessions only (headless `task run`) |
| `THURBOX_METRICS_DIR` | metrics output dir |
| `THURBOX_CONFIG_DIR` / `THURBOX_DATA_DIR` | the resolved config/data dirs, so the agent's `thurbox-cli` (its status hook) targets the same DB the TUI reads — independent of XDG, which `thurbox-cli` is on PATH, or a stale tmux-server env. Also honored if you set them yourself to relocate thurbox's state. |
| `THURBOX_SOCKET` | the multiplexer socket that instance's sessions live on, so an in-session `thurbox-cli` reaches the same server instead of re-deriving one from the session's own environment |
| `THURBOX_SOCKET_FOR` | the data dir that injected `THURBOX_SOCKET` belongs to. Read only to tell an inherited socket from one you exported: a child that points `THURBOX_DATA_DIR` somewhere else no longer matches, and derives its own socket instead of creating windows on the spawning instance's server |

`THURBOX_SESSION` is a **stable integration contract**, not an internal
detail of the hooks extension. It is set on the pane, so every process
started inside it inherits it — including an agent a driver of your own
launches there, and that agent's own hooks. Anything in the pane can
therefore report state with

```bash
thurbox-cli session signal --state <working|blocked|done|idle>
```

and no arguments at all; from outside the pane, pass `--session <uuid>`.
That is the supported way to give thurbox agent state for a session it
did not wire — for instance one created with a bare interactive shell as
its "agent" because a harness owns the real launch.

Two caveats. A **remote** session's `thurbox-cli` writes the *host's*
database: on a shared host (`share_sessions = true`, the default) that is
correct and the observer mirrors it, but on a non-shared host the signal
never reaches the local database — thurbox rewrites its own hooks to a
tmux pane option there for exactly this reason. And every shipped hook
command ends in `|| true`, so a failed signal is silent; `thurbox-cli
session doctor` is how to check the wiring.

Set **by** thurbox into every [lifecycle hook](#hookstoml) it runs
(`session_ops::lifecycle_hooks`), beside `THURBOX_SESSION`,
`THURBOX_SESSION_ID`, `THURBOX_TASK` and the location overrides above:

| Variable | Set into hook process |
|----------|-----------------------|
| `THURBOX_HOOK_EVENT` | the event, e.g. `session.pre_delete` |
| `THURBOX_SESSION_NAME`, `THURBOX_AGENT` | the session's name and agent |
| `THURBOX_REPO`, `THURBOX_CWD` | the primary repository, and the directory the agent runs in |
| `THURBOX_BRANCH`, `THURBOX_BASE_BRANCH` | the worktree branch and its base |
| `THURBOX_HOST` | the remote host name (local: unset) |
| `THURBOX_PARENT_SESSION` | the parent session id |

Set **at build time** (not runtime):

| Variable | Used for |
|----------|----------|
| `THURBOX_RELEASE_VERSION` | read by `build.rs` to inject the binary version at build (CI release workflow sets it, e.g. `v1.0.0`); absent → falls back to `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` |

Editor resolution order: DB `editor_command` → `$VISUAL` → `$EDITOR` →
error toast.

### Relocating an instance (`THURBOX_DATA_DIR`)

`THURBOX_CONFIG_DIR` and `THURBOX_DATA_DIR` move thurbox's config and its
database. Because the database *is* the record of which sessions exist, an
instance whose data dir has moved also gets a **multiplexer socket of its own**
— `thurbox-<digest of the data dir>` (`thurbox-dev-…` on a dev build) — instead
of creating its windows on the server holding your everyday sessions. That is
what makes a scratch instance safe to run a real `session create` in, and it is
also why its `automation-heartbeat` window is reclaimable: killing that
instance's server (`tmux -L "$(thurbox-cli version --json | jq -r .tmux_socket)"
kill-server`) takes the whole instance with it and touches nothing else.

Three rules keep the ordinary case ordinary:

- **The default instance never moves.** It stays on `thurbox`
  (`thurbox-dev` for a dev build), including when `THURBOX_DATA_DIR` merely
  restates the default — which is exactly what thurbox injects into every
  session it spawns.
- **A relocated *config* dir alone changes nothing.** It shares the default
  instance's database, and therefore its sessions and their server.
- **`THURBOX_SOCKET` wins over both**, so anything that needs the socket *by
  name* (the dev sandbox, whose teardown kills it) keeps naming it — **unless it
  was inherited from another instance.** thurbox injects the socket into every
  pane it spawns, paired with `THURBOX_SOCKET_FOR`, the data dir it belongs to.
  A `thurbox-cli` inside that pane which relocates *itself* — a sandbox, a test
  harness, an agent exporting its own `THURBOX_DATA_DIR` — no longer matches
  that pairing, so the inherited name is dropped and the derivation runs. An
  override you export yourself carries no pairing and still wins outright.
  Without this, isolating the database silently left the tmux server shared,
  which looks contained and is not.

Ask a build which server it is on rather than assuming: `thurbox-cli version
--json` reports the socket in force as `tmux_socket`, and `thurbox-cli config
show` prints it under `Sessions`.

**An instance relocated before this existed is a new instance.** Its old
sessions are still on the default server, and its database still lists them —
on the new socket they read as sessions whose window is gone. There is no
migration: point that instance back at the old server with
`THURBOX_SOCKET=thurbox` if you want them, or let it create fresh ones.

## Versioning

The SQLite schema migrates automatically (`schema_version` in
`metadata`). The TOML files carry a `config_version = 1` marker so a
future format change can migrate them too; current files are version 1
and the field is optional.

# Built-in Agents Reference

The exact configuration and runtime behavior of every **built-in** coding
agent, plus the checklist for **adding a new one**.

Thurbox is agent-neutral: it knows nothing about a coding agent's model,
prompts, permissions, or tools — only how to launch the CLI and how that CLI
resumes, forks, and reports status. Every agent is **data**, not code. The
built-ins are just the entries thurbox ships pre-seeded; a user adds their own
by editing `agents.toml` (see [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md#agentstoml) for the file
format). This document is the single source of truth for **what each built-in's
data actually is and why**, and it exists because adding a new built-in touches
several files that are *not* updated automatically — see
[Adding a new built-in agent](#adding-a-new-built-in-agent).

Related docs:

- [CONFIG.md → agents.toml](CONFIG.md#agentstoml) — the config-file format and
  per-field syntax (`{id}` substitution, `resume_latest`, `hook_schema`).
- [FEATURES.md → Agent definitions](FEATURES.md#agent-definitions) — the
  agents-as-data design.
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) — the `session::AgentDef` purity rule.
- `../.agents/skills/thurbox-agents/` → *Agent Definitions* — the in-repo
  working reference.

## Where the built-ins live

The built-in registry is **not** hand-constructed in Rust. It is an embedded
TOML document, `BUILTIN_AGENTS_TOML`, in
[`src/agent/agent_config.rs`](../src/agent/agent_config.rs). `builtin_registry()`
parses that string, and `seed_agents_toml()` writes it verbatim to
`~/.config/thurbox/agents.toml` on first run. So the same text is both the
in-binary fallback and the seed the user then edits — keep it authoritative.

Status hooks (working / blocked / done) are wired **separately** by the built-in
**hooks** extension, whose per-agent mechanism is declared in
[`extensions/hooks/extension.toml`](../extensions/hooks/extension.toml). An
`AgentDef` says *how to launch* an agent; the hooks manifest says *how that agent
reports state back*. Adding a built-in agent means touching **both**.

## The built-in agents

Ten entries ship pre-seeded — nine coding agents and a plain shell.
`default = "claude"`.

| Name | Command | Resume | Fork | ID model | Status hooks |
|------|---------|--------|------|----------|--------------|
| `claude` | `claude` | `--resume {id}` | `--resume {id} --fork-session` | **pinned** (`--session-id {id}`) | `--settings` arg patch (`claude.json`) |
| `codex` | `codex` | `resume --last` | `fork --last` | id-less (`resume_latest`) | `config_merges` → `~/.codex/hooks.json` |
| `antigravity` | `agy` | `--continue` | — (none) | id-less (`resume_latest`) | `config_merges` → `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json` |
| `opencode` | `opencode` | `--continue` | `--continue --fork` | id-less (`resume_latest`) | `external_files` → `~/.config/opencode/plugin/` |
| `aider` | `aider` | `--restore-chat-history` | — (none) | id-less (`resume_latest`) | `--notifications-command` arg patch (blocked only) |
| `copilot` | `copilot` | `--continue` | — (none) | id-less (`resume_latest`) | `external_files` → `~/.copilot/hooks/` |
| `vibe` | `vibe` | — (starts fresh) | — (none) | none | `external_files` → `~/.vibe/hooks.toml` |
| `pi` | `pi` | `--session-id {id}` | `--fork {id}` | **pinned** (`--session-id {id}`) | `external_files` → `~/.pi/agent/extensions/` |
| `omp` | `omp` | `--resume {home}/.omp/…/thurbox-{id}.jsonl` | — (none) | **path-pinned** (`--session <file>`) | `external_files` → `~/.omp/agent/extensions/` |
| `shell` | `bash -i` (`powershell -NoLogo` on Windows) | — (none) | — (none) | none | none (see below) |

### `shell` — the entry that is not a coding agent

`shell` exists so a session can be something other than an agent: you run
whatever you like in it, and an external driver can start its own tool with its
own flags rather than asking thurbox to model them. It is the ready-made form of
`session create --command`, and the only built-in whose `command` differs by
platform, because a native-Windows host runs psmux and PowerShell rather than
tmux and bash.

`args = ["-i"]` on POSIX is load-bearing rather than decoration: a plain `bash`
in a pane executes what is sent to it but renders **no prompt and no echo**, so
anything reading the screen to decide whether the session is ready sees a blank
pane that is nonetheless working.

It declares no `resume_args` or `fork_args`, and that absence is the statement:
a shell has no conversation. `session restart` replays its recipe in the same
directory (a shell barely notices — its history and cwd live on disk),
`session fork` gives you a second shell beside it, and `session create --resume`
silently starts fresh rather than attaching to anything (only a raw
`--command` session refuses `--resume` outright; see
[FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md#a-launch-recipe-is-not-a-conversation)). Nothing
wires status hooks for it either, so a `shell` session reports `hook_state: null`
until something in it calls `thurbox-cli session signal` — which anything in
the pane can, since
`THURBOX_SESSION` is in its environment.

### ID model: pinned vs. id-less

This is the single most important behavioral distinction, because it decides
whether resume/fork can target *this* session or only *the last* one.

- **Pinned** (`claude`, `pi`) — the CLI accepts a thurbox-generated UUID at
  creation via `new_session_args = ["--session-id", "{id}"]`, so it can
  resume/fork **that exact session** by id. `resume_latest` stays `false`.
- **Path-pinned** (`omp`) — the CLI generates its *own* internal session id and
  can't accept thurbox's, but it takes a session **file path**. thurbox maps its
  UUID to a deterministic JSONL under OMP's default root
  (`--session {home}/.omp/agent/sessions/thurbox-{id}.jsonl` on create,
  `--resume` on the same path to restore), so restart reattaches the exact
  session even though the id itself is opaque. The new `{home}` token is expanded
  to the resolved home dir **at spawn time by thurbox** (args are POSIX-quoted, so
  a literal `~` would never expand), and it translates onto the remote/WSL home.
  It has no `fork_args` (OMP can't pin a fork's target file to a thurbox UUID), so
  `Ctrl+F` starts fresh.
- **id-less** (`codex`, `antigravity`, `opencode`, `aider`, `copilot`) — the CLI
  can neither pin nor report a session id, so the agent's own flags resolve *"the
  last session in this directory"* (`codex resume --last`, `--continue`,
  `--restore-chat-history`). These entries set `resume_latest = true` and use no
  `{id}` token. This works because restart reuses the session's cwd and a
  single-repo fork reuses the parent's cwd. **Caveat:** a *multi-repo* fork lands
  in a fresh symlink workspace, so `--last`/`--continue` finds no parent session
  there (multi-repo *restart* still works — same workspace dir).
- **none** (`vibe`) — no resume group at all, so it always starts fresh on
  restart. The live tmux process is what carries its state across TUI restarts.

`resume_latest` only changes **when** the resume group fires
(`session_ops::resume_trigger_for`): for id-less agents restart always triggers
resume; for `claude` it defers to an on-disk transcript check.

### Fork

Agents that declare no `fork_args` (`antigravity`, `aider`, `copilot`, `vibe`,
`omp`) cannot fork — `Ctrl+F` starts a **fresh** session instead. None of those
CLIs support forking a conversation to a thurbox-pinned target.

### Status hook mechanisms

Every built-in reports status via the **hooks** extension, but *how* the hook is
delivered differs by what each CLI supports. Two entries below (`grok`, `kimi`)
are **not** built-in agents: their hooks are installed into their own config dirs
all the same, so a session running one — started from a `--command` shell, a
custom `agents.toml` entry, or an outside driver — reports state whoever launched
it. Naming the agent on the row (`session create --reports-as grok`) is what
resolves the coverage. All are declared in
[`extensions/hooks/extension.toml`](../extensions/hooks/extension.toml); the
embedded hook assets live in
[`extensions/hooks/`](../extensions/hooks/) and are `include_str!`'d by
[`src/session_ops/builtin_hooks.rs`](../src/session_ops/builtin_hooks.rs).

- **`agent_patches` (arg injection)** — appends args to the agent's launch
  command, reversibly.
  - `claude`: `--settings {home}/claude.json` (claude *merges* it with the user's
    own settings, never clobbering). Full lifecycle: idle/working/blocked/done.
  - `aider`: `--notifications-command "thurbox-cli session signal --state
    blocked"`. aider has only a "waiting for input" callback, so **blocked is the
    only state it can report**.
- **`config_merges` (reversible deep-merge into a shared config file)** — for
  agents whose hooks live in a file thurbox must not overwrite. JSON by default;
  `format = "toml"` selects the TOML merge for an agent whose shared config is
  TOML (kimi). Either way the semantics match: objects/tables recurse, arrays
  union, a type conflict with the user's value is left alone, and uninstall
  prunes exactly our entries. How "ours" is decided differs by format: JSON
  matches the `session signal` marker in an entry's content, while TOML reads an
  ownership comment stamped on each shipped entry — so a user hook that calls
  `session signal` itself survives a TOML uninstall, and a payload that renames
  an event replaces its old entry instead of stacking a second one beside it.
  - `codex`: merged into `~/.codex/hooks.json` (SessionStart→idle,
    UserPromptSubmit/PreToolUse→working, Stop→done; **no blocked**). *Experimental.*
  - `kimi` (Kimi Code CLI): merged into `~/.kimi-code/config.toml` — TOML, so
    the merge is `agent::toml_merge` (`format = "toml"` on the `[[config_merges]]`
    entry) rather than the JSON one; `toml_edit` keeps the user's comments and key
    order. Kimi reads hooks from a `[[hooks]]` array in that one shared file and
    has no drop-in hooks dir, so a managed file would clobber the user's whole
    configuration. SessionStart→idle, UserPromptSubmit/PreToolUse/PostToolUse→
    working, PermissionRequest→blocked, PermissionResult→working, Stop→done. The
    only agent here whose block edge is a **structured permission event on both
    sides** — a real request event and a real result event — so `blocked` neither
    false-fires nor latches. Kimi accepts exactly four keys per hook entry
    (event/command/matcher/timeout) and refuses to load the whole config file on a
    fifth, so `kimi-hooks.toml` must never grow one (a test pins this).
    *Experimental.*
  - `antigravity` (`agy`): merged into the global `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json`
    under a top-level `thurbox` key (PreInvocation→working, PreToolUse on ask_*→blocked,
    PostToolUse→working, Stop→done). Hook commands emit a JSON object on stdout.
- **`external_files` (drop a standalone managed file into the agent's config
  dir)** — refused if a non-managed file already exists there (the agent goes
  *unreported*, never *broken*).
  - `opencode`: a plugin at `~/.config/opencode/plugin/thurbox-status.js`
    (idle/working/blocked/done). The only agent with a real permission-*reply*
    event, so `permission.replied`→working clears the block exactly when it
    ends rather than at the next tool boundary.
  - `copilot`: `~/.copilot/hooks/thurbox-status.json`
    (sessionStart→idle, userPromptSubmitted/preToolUse/postToolUse→working,
    agentStop→done, notification matched to `permission_prompt`→blocked). Ships
    both `bash` and `powershell` commands.
    *Experimental.*
  - `vibe`: a managed `~/.vibe/hooks.toml` (pre_tool→working, post_agent→done;
    **no blocked** — vibe has no permission/notification hook). Verified against
    vibe 2.21.0.
  - `pi`: a TypeScript extension at `~/.pi/agent/extensions/thurbox-status.ts`
    (session_start→idle, agent_start/tool_execution_start/tool_execution_end→
    working, agent_end→done; **blocked inferred only** from an
    `ask_user_question` tool call, cleared when that tool ends). *Experimental.*
  - `grok` (xAI's Grok Build CLI): `~/.grok/hooks/thurbox-status.json` — grok
    loads every `*.json` in that dir on its own, so a standalone drop never
    touches a hook file the user wrote. It is the **global** dir deliberately:
    global hooks are always trusted and load on first launch, while
    `<project>/.grok/hooks` additionally needs the folder granted trust in grok's
    own `~/.grok/trusted_folders.toml` (or a `--trust` launch flag, which would
    only cover sessions thurbox itself launches). grok is Claude-Code-compatible,
    so the mapping mirrors claude: SessionStart→idle,
    UserPromptSubmit/PreToolUse/PostToolUse→working, Notification (its `message`
    matched to permission/approval)→blocked, Stop→done. Every command is
    deliberately `$`-free: a `$VAR` reference without an inline `:-default` makes
    grok silently refuse to load the whole hook file, so the blocked edge pipes
    the extracted message through `grep` instead of claude's `case` (a test pins
    it). *Experimental.*
  - `omp`: a TypeScript extension at `~/.omp/agent/extensions/thurbox-status.ts`,
    mirroring pi's but mapping OMP's structured user-question tool — named `ask`
    — to blocked (it recognizes both `ask` and pi's `ask_user_question`), cleared
    by tool_execution_end. Verified against OMP 17.0.6. *Experimental.*

Each `requires_dir` guard makes the drop a no-op when that agent isn't installed,
so a fresh install with only claude present doesn't scatter files for agents you
don't have.

**Deliberately uninstrumented.** Two agents have a hook surface thurbox cannot
reach with any of the three mechanisms, and are left out of the table so they
keep reporting `uncovered` honestly rather than claiming a payload that never
fires:

- **cursor** (`cursor-agent`). The only scope its CLI is known to load hooks
  from is per-project `<repo>/.cursor/hooks.json`, and only when the agent is
  launched with `--trust` — which is a `[[agent_patches]]` flag, so it would
  cover nothing an outside driver launches, and a per-repo file is not a config
  dir any mechanism here writes to. User-scope `~/.cursor/hooks.json` is
  documented for the IDE; in the CLI it is reported to run only the
  shell/MCP/file-edit hooks, none of which can say `done`. Wiring it there would
  latch a session at `working` forever. It becomes a plain `config_merges` entry
  into `~/.cursor/hooks.json` the moment `stop`/`sessionStart` are confirmed to
  fire from user scope in the CLI.
- **muse** (Muse Code). Its hooks exist only as capabilities of a native plugin:
  installing one means running `muse plugins install` and `muse plugins approve`
  (the management CLI itself gated behind `MUSE_EXPERIMENTAL_PLUGINS`), and a
  dropped-in config file is silently ignored. An extension manifest writes files;
  it does not run an agent's install-and-approve commands, so there is nothing to
  ship. Muse does keep a durable per-session event log
  (`${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/muse/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/<uuid>/session.jsonl`)
  whose `run` `started`/`terminal` events bracket every turn — reading it would be
  a **fourth** delivery mechanism (a poller, not a hook) and is a separate
  decision, not a variation on these three.

**This list has a machine-readable twin.** `session::hook_status::
AGENT_HOOK_COVERAGE` carries the same per-agent facts — the states each payload
signals, its delivery mechanism, the file it lands in, and whether its `blocked`
is a text match on a notification body — and is what `session get`/`list` report
as `hook_coverage` / `hook_states_reportable` / `hook_delivery` /
`hook_blocked_is_heuristic`, so a consumer can tell "this agent is quiet" from
"this agent cannot say that". The table is asserted against the embedded
payloads by a test rather than maintained by hand beside them: **change a
payload's events and that test fails until the table agrees.**

`thurbox-cli session doctor [uuid]` is the runtime half — whether a given
session's payload is actually installed where its agent reads it, whether a hook
command could resolve `thurbox-cli` at all, and whether what was last reported
is corroborated by the pane. A `--command` session is the one shape it does not
judge: thurbox never had an agent there to wire, so it reports **no hooks
expected** rather than broken wiring.

**A pane can run an agent thurbox did not launch.** A `--command` session is
named after the command's file stem, so a driver that opens a shell and starts
`claude` inside it has no declared agent for the fields above to resolve
against. When the pane probe has already named one, that name is used and
coverage reads `presumed` (`hook_coverage_source: "detection"`) — deliberately
not `full`, because seeing an agent in a pane is evidence about the process and
never about whether its hooks are wired. Undeclared and unprobed, it stays
coverage `none` with `hook_blocked_is_heuristic: false`, which asserts the block
signal is structured when it is claude's text match on a notification
message. `session create --reports-as <agent>` and
`thurbox-cli session reports-as <ref> <agent>` (`--clear` to take it back) let
the driver name the agent that actually reports; it is stored on the row
(`sessions.reports_as`, schema v44), survives restart, and changes nothing about
the launch — `session restart` still replays the recorded command. Only an agent
in the table above (or a custom agent that asserts a family with `hook_schema`)
may be declared: a name with no coverage would unlock nothing, silently.

**On a shared host** (`hosts.toml` `share_sessions = true`, the default — see
ADR-24) none of the remote rewriting applies: the host's own `thurbox-cli`
launches the agent with the host's own hooks extension, so each agent reports
exactly as it does locally, into the host's database, which the remote thurbox
mirrors. That includes a **Windows (psmux) host**, whose remote path stays
gated (`psmux_hook_rewrite_supported`) but is simply not used when the host
has — or is provisioned with — a CLI.

### `hook_schema` (custom rebrands only)

The built-ins never set `hook_schema` — the hooks extension already knows them by
name. It exists for a **user's** custom agent that runs a built-in under a
different name (e.g. a rebranded-claude CLI called `fleet`): set `hook_schema =
"claude"` and it inherits claude's `--settings` hook wiring under its own name.
Only the per-arg-patch families (`claude`, `aider`) need it; the config-dir
agents (codex/opencode/antigravity/vibe/copilot/pi/omp/grok/kimi) wire through their own config
dir, so a rebrand sharing that dir already reports without it. See
[CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md#agentstoml) and the `AgentDef.hook_schema` doc comment.

## Adding a new built-in agent

Adding support for a new CLI as a **user** needs only an `agents.toml` edit — no
recompile (that's the whole point of agents-as-data). But promoting a CLI to a
shipped **built-in** touches several places that are **not** kept in sync
automatically. Work the checklist top to bottom:

1. **Seed entry** — add an `[[agents]]` block to `BUILTIN_AGENTS_TOML` in
   [`src/agent/agent_config.rs`](../src/agent/agent_config.rs). Set `command`,
   the resume/fork/new-session groups, and `resume_latest` per the ID model
   above. Add a short comment explaining the CLI's resume/fork semantics, as the
   existing entries do. **Decide the ID model first** — whether the CLI can pin a
   session id — because it determines every `*_args` group.

2. **Status hooks** — add the wiring to
   [`extensions/hooks/extension.toml`](../extensions/hooks/extension.toml) and
   the hook asset file under [`extensions/hooks/`](../extensions/hooks/). Pick the
   mechanism from [Status hook mechanisms](#status-hook-mechanisms):
   `agent_patches` if hooks are launch flags, `config_merges` if they live in a
   shared config file thurbox must not clobber, `external_files` for a standalone
   drop into the agent's own config dir. Register any new embedded asset with an
   `include_str!` in
   [`src/session_ops/builtin_hooks.rs`](../src/session_ops/builtin_hooks.rs), and
   add its row to `AGENT_HOOK_COVERAGE` in
   [`src/session/hook_status.rs`](../src/session/hook_status.rs) (the drift test
   fails until it matches the payload), and — for a `config_merges` /
   `external_files` wiring — the matching entry in `remote_asset_for`
   ([`src/session_ops/remote_hooks.rs`](../src/session_ops/remote_hooks.rs)), so
   remote sessions get the same payload (a test fails until local and remote
   agree). Bump the hooks extension `version`. Skipping this step means the new
   agent launches fine but **never shows working/blocked/done**.

   This step also stands **alone**: an agent thurbox ships no `[[agents]]` entry
   for still gets its hooks installed into its own config dir, which is what
   makes `grok`/`kimi` report for a driver that launches them itself. Steps 1,
   3 and 4 are about launching an agent, not instrumenting one.

3. **Docs — update every list of built-ins** (these are prose, not generated, so
   they drift):
   - [The built-in agents](#the-built-in-agents) table above.
   - [CONFIG.md → agents.toml](CONFIG.md#agentstoml) — the parenthetical list and
     the "N built-ins" count.
   - [FEATURES.md → Agent definitions](FEATURES.md#agent-definitions) — the prose
     list and the pinned-id sentence.
   - `../.agents/skills/thurbox-agents/` → *Agent Definitions* and
     *Custom-agent status hooks* — the built-in lists and the resume/fork
     caveats.

4. **Tests** — the seed TOML must still parse and produce the expected registry.
   Run the agent-config tests and update any fixture that enumerates the built-in
   set:

   ```bash
   cargo nextest run -E 'test(agent)'
   ```

5. **Verify end-to-end** (optional but recommended) — install the CLI and confirm
   in a sandbox that resume, fork, and the status dot all behave:

   ```bash
   scripts/dev/sandbox.sh
   ```

### What is auto-handled (don't do these)

- No provider code — `agent::GenericProvider` drives *any* `AgentDef` from its
  data; there is no per-agent Rust launcher to write.
- No agent picker change — the new-session picker reads the registry.
- No migration for existing users — `agents.toml` is only seeded when absent, so
  a new built-in appears for **fresh installs**; existing users keep their file
  and add the entry themselves (this is intentional — thurbox never rewrites a
  user's edited config).
